# Pomodoro Timer
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
