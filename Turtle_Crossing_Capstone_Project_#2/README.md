# Turtle Crossy Road
Overview: Turtle Crossy Road is a simple arcade-style game developed using the Turtle module in Python and is inspired by the classic game Crossy Road. The player controls a turtle character and aims to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars. The player moves the turtle upwards using the up arrow key, avoiding incoming traffic. The game becomes progressively challenging as the player advances, with cars moving faster and appearing more frequently.
